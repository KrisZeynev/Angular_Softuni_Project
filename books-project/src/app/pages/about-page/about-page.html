    <p class="about-text">
      This is my Angular app that allows authenticated users to create new books. If the currently authenticated user is
      the owner of a book, they have the ability to edit or delete the book. Every authenticated user can add comments,
      and only the owner of a comment can edit or delete it.<br/><br/>

      Non-authenticated users can only view the already added books and see their details, but they cannot interact with
      them.
